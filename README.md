# React + Vite
# FULLSTACK-KURSSI: notes-app, in its various states, will be developed here. Two repos: front and back, since otherwise there may be trouble with .git (unaccessable folder in GitHub if both front and back are in the same repo, apparently...)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
